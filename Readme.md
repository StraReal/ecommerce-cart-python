A simple, terminal-based e-commerce shopping cart system built with Python.

This project allows users to register, log in, browse products, manage a shopping cart, and simulate a checkout process â€” all from the command line. Itâ€™s designed as a beginner-friendly project to reinforce core Python concepts such as functions, control flow, data structures, file I/O, and error handling.
